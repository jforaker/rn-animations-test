# Instructions

This project includes a very simple flash card app. You are to change this app 
so that the card transitions are animated.

The animation to advance from one card to another should be different than the
animation to reveal the answer or question.

Moving to the previous card should use the reverse of the animation when 
moving to the next card. Note: The animation should be the "logical" reverse,
which might not be the literal reverse.

Similarly, revealing the answer should be use the reverse animation of 
revealing the question.

The general formatting of the cards should remain the same. The content should
be vertically centered unless the content is large enough that it needs to be
scrolled.

If you want to go above and beyond, show part of the question when the answer
is displayed (which can help to memorize things faster).

The goal for this project is to make nice, fluid animations which are
simultaneously unobtrusive. The application needs to be attractive to entice
users to use it, but goal is to help users learn. So the animations should not
distract from that.
